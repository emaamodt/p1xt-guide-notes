HTML
	Include the doctype: <!DOCTYPE html>

	Put a meta tag with correct charset in the head: <meta charset="utf-8">

	Don't forget to use validators!
		HTML: http://validator.w3.org/
		CSS: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

	Link CSS stylesheet in the head:
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">

	Don't use headings just to make the text big or bold!

	Special character endcodings: http://copypastecharacter.com/

CSS
	Resets - CSS resets take every common HTML element with a predefined style and provide one unified style for all browsers. These resets generally involve removing any sizing, margins, paddings, or additional styles and toning these values down.

	Basic: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
	Advanced: http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

	selectors w/ higher specificity take precedence no matter where they appear in the CSS cascade
	ex) id > class
