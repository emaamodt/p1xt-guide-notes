Everything is not an object.
	NULL is not an object - that's a bug that says null is a typeof object

Objects
	Arrays
	Functions


Built-In Objects
	String
	Number
	Boolean
	Object
	Function
	Array
	Date
	RegExp
	Error

	Can all be used as constructors (can use "new" operator)

Primitives are temporarily coerced to objects when properties or methods are called on them

Weird exceptions:
	null and undefined have no object wrapper form. 
	Date values can only be created  w/ constructed object form
	Errors are also objects

RegExp, Array, Object, Function are all functions regardless of which form is used - USE LITERAL UNLESS YOU NEED EXTRA OPTIONS

There are no methods. Just functions. The terms are interchangeable.
