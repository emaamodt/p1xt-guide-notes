REACT NOTES

Prop types 
	Set the type of props if you know it.
	Throws a warning message.

	EX) MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }

	Note: As of React v15.5.0, PropTypes is imported independently from React, like this:

	import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';

Accessing Props with ES6 Class Components
 -Use "this"
 EX) {this.props.data}

Stateless functional component: any function which accepts props and returns JSX
Stateless component: class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state
Stateful component (AKA "components" or "react components"): any component that maintains its own internal state

-Minimize stateful components to limit statefulness to specific parts of application

EX of stateless components and Stateless functional components
	const Items = (props) => {
	  return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>
	};

	// change code below this line
	Items.propTypes = {quantity: PropTypes.number.isRequired}
	// change code above this line

	Items.defaultProps = {
	  quantity: 0
	};

	class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {
	  constructor(props) {
	    super(props);
	  }
	  render() {
	    return <Items />
	  }
	};

State: data your app needs to know about that can change over time

CREATE A STATE
	declare a state property on the component class in its constructor
	must set the state property to a Javascript object

	this.state = {
  		name: 'Emily'
	}
	
	component will always have access to data in state in its render() method using this.state

	to access a state value w/in the return of the render method, use {}
		ex) <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
	Can also render state in the render section before return
		ex) class MyComponent extends React.Component {
			  constructor(props) {
			    super(props);
			    this.state = {
			      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
			    }
			  }
			  render() {
			    // change code below this line
			    const name = this.state.name;
			    // change code above this line
			    return (
			      <div>
			        { /* change code below this line */ }
			        <h1>{name}</h1>
			        { /* change code above this line */ }
			      </div>
			    );
			  }
			};
			
	-virtual DOM keeps track of changes, re-renders components when state updates

	-state is encapsulated/local to the component unless you pass state data to a child component as props
